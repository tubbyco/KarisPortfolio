                TVS Digital builds AI-powered solutions for the fintech and
                automotive sectors, supporting brands like Mazda, Honda, and
                Wheeltek across Asia. Its platforms help businesses manage loan
                origination, credit decisioning, collections, and field
                operations more efficiently. During my internship, I designed
                key parts of the Unified Portal, a centralised system created to
                consolidate multiple loan and collections workflows into one
                streamlined interface. The portal improves visibility, reduces
                manual processes, and helps branch teams make faster,
                data-driven decisions.

                I was responsible for designing end-to-end flows for the Loan
                Management and Cashier modules. This included understanding
                requirements, mapping user journeys, creating wireframes and
                prototypes to ensure consistency with the unified design system.
                I worked closely with product managers and designers to simplify
                complex workflows such as payment recording, memo tracking, and
                loan status management and translated them into clear, usable
                screens for branch officers.

              <p class="info-body">
               Before the Unified Portal was introduced, the Loan Management System (LMS) was spread across multiple disconnected tasks and interfaces. Loan managers had to navigate separate modules for price lists, sales data, loan disbursement, and inventory, which makes it difficult to track information cohesively. User journeys showed that managers struggled with reviewing large volumes of applications, incomplete data, and unclear approval paths. This fragmented structure led to inefficiencies, slower decision-making, and a heavy reliance on manual coordination between teams.

                These early wireframes and the information architecture diagram represent our initial exploration into how the loan application process could be organized. At this stage, the focus was on defining content hierarchy, identifying key steps in the loan review process, and mapping out how users would move between sections. This ideation work helped clarify what information needed to be grouped together, where bottlenecks existed, and how the overall flow could be simplified before moving into high-fidelity design.

            <div>
              <p class="info-body">
           The process of designing the unified portal took many rounds of meetings and careful planning to map user flows, clarify requirements, and organise the modules into a coherent structure. Given how tedious and confusing the original system was, a large part of the work involved aligning stakeholders, validating assumptions, and making sure every step made sense for real users. This project really showed me how much teamwork, clarity, and patience matter when designing something this complex.
